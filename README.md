**Great project done with udemy course but i understand it fully. Now i update it because i want to build my portfolio. 5 hours long, did it in 3 days then today i revisit it in 2,5h and upload**

**Some great feautres, like searching and filtering in very elegant way, use of cache and rate limiting, very advanced local scopes and even blade component for showing stars (small thing but nice)**
